**[Le Diable](https://lediable.netlify.app/)** is a fictional resaurant. I design and built it from scratch with a multiple page website when I was learning the basics of Web Development HTML CSS and JavaScrip. I spent couple of weeks designing, coding and thinking a possible nice outcome.

It is a responsive restaurant website with multiple pages and elegant user interface with cool animations. It has a static data but I am planning to take it to another level by making it dynamic. It has a features of:

• **Booking a table** - Customers can reserve a table by providing their personal information, date and time of reservation and the quantity of person every table.

• **Menu** - Menu page has filters for different meals of the day and a search input where can you search by name or recipe. Every dish display their specific ingredients, price and the ratings.

• **Delivery and Choosing a restaurant** - This fictional restaurant have fictional branches where can you book a delivery to a specific restaurant nears you.

• **Work application** - In this ficitional restaurant you can also apply as a delivery rider, where forms is validated.

I believe that with the right technology this website will scale. I am planning to rebuild the site with the right tech stack.
