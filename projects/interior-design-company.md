Elegance is a website for a fictional interior design firm with smooth scroll motion and multiple pages. I design and built it from scratch. The website is developed using Adobe XD for designing. HTML, CSS and JavaScript for coding. I enjoyed building this project and learnt a lot espeially layouting using CSS.
