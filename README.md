My name is [Jericho P. Bantiquete](https://jerichobantiquete.vercel.app/), A bachelorߴs degree holder with web development experience and passion for software development. Currently based in the Philippines, i love to build things.

I absolutely love crafting and bringing to life responsive websites and web apps from scratch. For my personal and freelance projects, I dive into an exciting toolbox that includes HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Clerk, styled components, Next.js with TypeScript, PHP Laravel, MySQL, Alpine.js, Git, GitHub, Figma, and VS Code. Currently, Iߴm expanding my skills by learning about vim, improving my understanding of Data Structures & Algorithms, exploring Astro, looking into NEXT13 (app directory), diving into the T3 Stack, and studying GO. In addition, I have a basic grasp of programming languages like C, C++, Java, and Python, which I learned during my time at university. I am also offering assistance in developing systems for those in their bachelorߴs or masterߴs degree.
